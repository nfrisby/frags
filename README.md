Take a look at [BLOG1.md](BLOG1.md),
which I'm currently iterating on.
I think all the main ideas are there,
but the presentation is definitely a work in progress,
and some more details might deserve to be added.
Eventually I'll transition work to a second post,
probably once I upload the plugin itself.
